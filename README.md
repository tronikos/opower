# opower

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/opower.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/opower/)

A Python library and command-line tool for getting historical and forecasted usage/cost data from utilities that use opower.com.

This library is used by the [Opower integration in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/opower/).

**Note:** Utilities marked with an asterisk require the **[tronikos/opower-login-service](https://github.com/tronikos/opower-login-service)**. This service handles complex login flows (e.g. heavy JavaScript) that cannot be managed by this library directly. It can be run as a Home Assistant Add-on or a Docker container.

### Adding a New Utility

To add support for a new Opower-based utility, follow these steps:

1. **Verify it's an Opower utility:** Use your browser's developer tools on your utility's website. If the network tab shows requests to a domain like `utility.opower.com`, it's a good candidate.
2. **Create a utility file:** Add a new file in `src/opower/utilities` that inherits from `UtilityBase`. Name the file after the utility's website (e.g., `newutility.py` for `newutility.com`).
3. **Respect scraping limitations:** This library is used by Home Assistant and must adhere to its [architecture rules](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0004-webscraping.md). A headless browser cannot be a dependency, and HTML parsing is only allowed for the authentication phase.
    > An exception is made for the authentication phase. An integration is allowed to extract fields from forms. To make it more robust, data should not be gathered by scraping individual fields but instead scrape all fields at once.
4. **Login with a headless browser:** If the utility's login requires a headless browser, you will need to add support to the **[tronikos/opower-login-service](https://github.com/tronikos/opower-login-service)**. See the implementation for Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) as an example.
